# Give it a try!
A live version of the game is available [here](https://ismalf.github.io/invaders/)

**Note**: From what I have witnessed, the Acceleration API does not work on iOS devices, so I'm working on some controls to move the ship and shoot so it feels _ok_.

# About 

This project was developed as a way to learn the basics of React in a fun way.

This project is an example of:
* Some interesting concepts of game development such as the game loop and collisions
* React routing (had some trouble deploying to github pages)
* JS generator functions (really useful while animating the initialization of a new game, when enemy ships are spawned in order)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
