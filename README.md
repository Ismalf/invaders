# About 

This project was developed as a way to learn React on my own.
Reading the documentation I was able to put together a menu, about page, game screen and score screen.

Other things I learned throuh the development of this project:
Core concepts of game development
How React Routes work (had some trouble deploying to github pages)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
